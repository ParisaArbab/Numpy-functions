# Numpy-functions
implement some function of Numpy library

This code demonstrates various operations using NumPy arrays:

Creation of arrays a, b, c, and d using different methods such as arange() and linspace().
Reshaping array a to a 10x10 two-dimensional array.
Accessing specific elements or rows of arrays using indexing (a[4,5] and a[4]).
Computing the sum of all elements in array d.
Finding the maximum value in array a.
Transposing array b, which flips the matrix over its diagonal.
Performing element-wise addition and multiplication between arrays a and d.
Calculating the dot product of arrays a and d, which involves summing the products of corresponding elements of rows of the first matrix with corresponding elements of columns of the second matrix.
Each operation is accompanied by explanatory comments to clarify its purpose and the expected output.
